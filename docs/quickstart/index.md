# Quickstart

Want to jump right in to using `piqtree`? This is the place to be! Here, you can find examples to:

- [Construct a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree.](construct_ml_tree.md)
- [Fit branch lengths to a tree topology from an alignment.](fit_tree_topology.md)
- [Use different kinds of substitution models.](using_substitution_models.md)
- [Find the model of best fit with ModelFinder.](using_model_finder.md)
- [Calculate pairwise Jukes-Cantor distances.](calculate_jc_distances.md)
- [Construct a rapid neighbour-joining tree from a distance matrix.](construct_nj_tree.md)
- [Make a randomly generated phylogenetic tree.](make_random_tree.md)
- [Calculate pairwise Robinson-Foulds distances between trees.](calculate_rf_distances.md)

Be sure to check out the [API Reference](../api/index.md) for full usage!
